<p>
Accessibility is a major challenge of machine learning (ML). Typical ML models are built by specialists and require specialized hardware/software as well as ML experience to validate.<br>
The accessibility challenge also makes collaboration more difficult and limits the ML researcherâ€™s exposure to realistic data and scenarios that occur in the wild.<br>
o improve accessibility and facilitate collaboration,
GradioML team developed an open-source Python package, which allows researchers to rapidly generate a visual interface for their ML models.
It makes accessing any ML model as easy as opening a URL in your browser.

In this talk had been joined by Gradio CEO and Co-Founder <b> Abubakar Abid </b> who will take us through building a visual interface for machine learning models with Gradio. You can learn more about Gradio by visiting their website  <a href="https://www.gradio.app/">Gradio  </a>
