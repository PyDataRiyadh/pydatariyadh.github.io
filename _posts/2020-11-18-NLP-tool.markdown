<p>
In this talk we have had <a href="https://twitter.com/fishnets88">Vincent </a> .He showed us how Rasa works.<br> With creating a simple chatbot from the command line and give an overview of how the NLU pipelines work.<br>
He also explained his new effort to make this technology more available for non-English users.<br>
He  demonstrated some tools he’s made available for Arabic but he’d love to get feedback from the community.
Finally he wrap up his talk with a “bulk labelling demo” that might inspire more folks to experiment with NLP in jupyter notebooks.
