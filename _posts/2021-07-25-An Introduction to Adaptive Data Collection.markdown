Talk Summary:
How can we efficiently adapt to situations where existing data is limited, and new data is costly to collect?
One approach is to sequentially collect data, by iteratively using the data we have to choose which data points we should collect next.

Join us to learn more about the concept of adaptive data collection
and its application in domains as varied as baking, hyperparameter selection, and social science.

About the Speaker:
Mohammed is a PhD student at MIT exploring computational social science. Prior to graduate school, he led the data science team at Mozn, where he focused on creating user-friendly products that employed quantitative approaches to solve real-world problems.
